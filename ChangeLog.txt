----------
		Feng Gao add one new parameter of IMQ module(3.18,4.0,and 4.1), imq_dev_accurate_stats (default is 1).
		It is used to notify if IMQ get the accurate stats. 
		When imq_dev_accurate_stats is 0, it could avoid one spin to enhance the performance.

----------
		Feng Gao removed usless skb_cb_store_lock of 4.0 patch. It will be merged into other patches if it is ok.

Germano Michel <germanomichel@gmail.com>:
               - Fix IMQ for net namespaces
 
 
2011/08/16:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Clear IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING flag that was added for linux 3.0.2

2011/07/26:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Add queue mapping checks for packets exiting IMQ.
               - Port to 3.0

2011/07/12:
-----------
syoder89@gmail.com:
               - Crash fix that happens when the receiving interface has more
                 than one queue (add missing skb_set_queue_mapping in
                 imq_select_queue).

2011/03/18:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.38

Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.35
               - Simplify hook registration by using nf_register_hooks.
               - nf_reinject doesn't need spinlock around it, therefore remove
                 imq_nf_reinject function. Other nf_reinject users protect
                 their own data with spinlock. With IMQ however all data is
                 needed is stored per skbuff, so no locking is needed.
               - Changed IMQ to use 'separate' NF_IMQ_QUEUE instead of
                 NF_QUEUE, this allows working coexistance of IMQ and other
                 NF_QUEUE users.
               - Make IMQ multi-queue. Number of IMQ device queues can be
                 increased with 'numqueues' module parameters. Default number
                 of queues is 1, in other words by default IMQ works as
                 single-queue device. Multi-queue selection is based on
                 IFB multi-queue patch by Changli Gao <xiaosuo@gmail.com>.

2009/12/08:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
               - Port to 2.6.32
               - Add check for skb->nf_queue_entry==NULL in imq_dev_xmit()
               - Also add better error checking for skb->nf_queue_entry usage 

 
2009/09/26:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
                - Add imq_nf_reinject_lockless to fix deadlock with
                  imq_nf_queue/imq_nf_reinject.

 
2009/04/20:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
                - Use netdevice feature flags to avoid extra packet handling
                  by core networking layer and possibly increase performance.

 
2009/04/12:
-----------
Jussi Kivilinna:
                - 2.6.27 and newer overwrite control buffer. 
                - Add skb_save_cb/skb_restore_cb helper functions for backuping
                  control buffer. This is needed because qdisc-layer on kernels
                - Add better locking for IMQ device. Hopefully this will solve SMP issues. 
                - Port to 2.6.27
                - Port to 2.6.28
                - Port to 2.6.29 + fix rmmod not working


2008/08/06:
-----------
        2.6.26 - (JK)
               - Replaced tasklet with 'netif_schedule()'.
               - Cleaned up and added comments for imq_nf_queue().


2008/06/17:
-----------
        2.6.25 - Changed imq.c to use qdisc_run() instead of qdisc_restart() and moved 
                 qdisc_run() to tasklet to avoid recursive locking. 
                 New initialization routines to fix 'rmmod' not working anymore. Used code from ifb.c. (Jussi Kivilinna)

 
2005/12/16:  
-----------
        IMQ versions between 2.6.7 and 2.6.13 were released with almost no problems. 
	2.6.14-x was released with some important changes: nfcache was removed.
        After some weeks of trouble we figured out that some IMQ fields in skb were missing 
        in skbuff.c - skb_clone and copy_skb_header.
        These functions are correctly patched by this new patch version.
        Thanks for all who helped to figure out all the problems with
        2.6.14.x: 
           - Patrick McHardy, Rune Kock, VeNoMouS, Max CtRiX, Kevin Shanahan, Richard Lucassen, 
             Valery Dachev (hopefully I didn't forget anybody). I apologize again for my lack of time.
